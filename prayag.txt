Bridge course
The strength of our relationship with the students is our ability to gauge their strengths and weaknesses. Orientation Programmes and Bridge courses conducted by the different departments at the beginning of the academic year are an effort on our part to fill-in the chasm that exists between the shared knowledge of students at the entry-level and the course requirements.
It is observed that NCERT syllabus as it is about 20-30% more vast than the previous state board syllabus. While those who have studied ICSE or CBSE in school are not much affected, but those from the State syllabus may find it difficult. Bridge course helps students to open up, think creatively and become responsible and independent students. The objective of the Bridge course is to demystify what is expected of students in Pre University-level classes and to provide adequate foundation in the core applied science subjects and English limited to moderate level so that students do not face any difficulty when the classes commence. To phase in students to Engineering and enjoy education, overview through project based learning is also envisaged. The sessions also include ice breakers, Sports and Cultural Activities for all round development. During this interaction of few days with the faculty, the students will come out of their hesitation and it will be the best platform for the students to interact with the faculty members, making it responsible for them to build strong relationships with faculty, advisers and other students.
This course was conducted last year for our students. The statistics show that, there is a gradual improvement of more than 20-30% in the overall performance of the students. Their parents have also deeply appreciated.
